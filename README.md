# Dash-canopy-dive
A simple web app can identify canopy feature running through onnx model. 

This application used  onnxruntime which only works for python 3.7 > version.

I tried playing with the windows version of it. But i was unable to use run it due to python errors. 

I was able to run onnxruntime on anaconda environment. It wasnt successful due to path limitation. 

The best way to try this out is using a ubuntu environment. 

pip install dash<br>
pip install onnxruntime
